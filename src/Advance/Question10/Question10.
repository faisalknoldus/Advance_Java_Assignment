Q10. Is the below code written correctly? If not then give reason.

class A
{
    String s = "AAA";

    void methodA()
    {
        System.out.println(s);
    }

    static class B
    {
        void methodB()
        {
            methodA();
        }
    }
}

Answer: no this program is not correct
Explanation: we canâ€™t use non-static method of outer class inside a static nested class directly. You have to instantiate the outer class.
